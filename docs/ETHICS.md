# Ethics Statement

## 1. Purpose and Ethical Scope

BiasLab is a research project focused on the **comparative analysis of language model outputs**.
Its purpose is to improve transparency, auditability, and public understanding of how different AI systems generate narratives under identical conditions.

The project is **descriptive and analytical**, not normative or judgmental.

---

## 2. What BiasLab Does *Not* Do

BiasLab explicitly does **not**:

- label models as “good”, “bad”, “biased”, or “unbiased”,
- assign moral intent or political ideology to models,
- evaluate policy compliance or legal liability,
- make claims about the internal motivations of model creators,
- provide rankings, leaderboards, or competitive scores.

Observed differences are treated as **empirical phenomena**, not value judgments.

---

## 3. Human Subjects and Personal Data

BiasLab does **not** involve:

- human participants,
- personal data collection,
- user profiling,
- behavioral tracking,
- biometric or sensitive personal information.

All analyzed content consists of **synthetic model outputs** generated in controlled experimental settings.

No GDPR-relevant personal data is processed.

---

## 4. Sensitive Topics and Harm Mitigation

Some prompts may touch on:
- social categories,
- ethical dilemmas,
- normatively sensitive concepts.

Safeguards include:
- neutral, non-provocative prompt phrasing,
- avoidance of hate speech, slurs, or explicit harm,
- documentation-first approach instead of amplification.

The goal is to **observe differences**, not to provoke extreme outputs.

---

## 5. Interpretation Responsibility

BiasLab separates clearly between:

- **measurement** (what differs),
- **interpretation** (what it might mean).

Interpretive conclusions are left to:
- researchers,
- reviewers,
- readers.

BiasLab does not embed interpretive bias into its metrics or outputs.

---

## 6. Model Neutrality

All models are treated as:

- black-box systems,
- socio-technical artifacts,
- products of complex training and alignment processes.

BiasLab does not assume:
- malicious intent,
- ideological agendas,
- uniform design goals across models.

---

## 7. Transparency and Reproducibility

Ethical integrity is supported through:

- open-source code,
- documented methodology,
- reproducible experiments,
- versioned prompt datasets.

This allows independent verification and critical scrutiny.

---

## 8. Risk of Misuse

Potential misuse risks include:
- cherry-picking outputs,
- decontextualized interpretation,
- sensational framing.

To mitigate this, BiasLab emphasizes:
- full context availability,
- access to raw responses,
- explicit methodological limitations.

---

## 9. Licensing and Openness

All published code and research artifacts are released under open licenses.
This ensures:
- public accountability,
- collaborative improvement,
- non-exclusive access.

No proprietary or confidential data is included.

---

## 10. Alignment with Public-Interest Research

BiasLab aligns with principles promoted by:
- open science,
- responsible AI research,
- digital commons initiatives.

The project is intended to support:
- informed public discourse,
- evidence-based policy discussions,
- academic research into AI behavior and alignment.

---

## 11. Ethical Review

BiasLab does not require institutional ethical approval, as it:
- does not involve human subjects,
- does not process personal data,
- does not perform intervention studies.

Ethical considerations are nevertheless documented proactively to ensure clarity and accountability.
